# MultiplexingHolography

Off-axis holographic multiplexing involves capturing several complex wavefronts, each
encoded into off-axis holograms with different interference fringe orientations, simultaneously,
with a single camera acquisition. Thus, the multiplexed off-axis hologram
can capture several wavefronts at once, where each one encodes different information
from the sample, using the same number of pixels typically required for acquiring a
single conventional off-axis hologram encoding only one sample wavefront. This gives
rise to many possible applications, with focus on acquisition of dynamic samples, with
hundreds of scientific papers already published in the last decade. These include fieldof-view
multiplexing, depth-of-field multiplexing, angular perspective multiplexing for
tomographic phase microscopy for 3-D refractive index imaging, multiple wavelength
multiplexing for multiwavelength phase unwrapping or for spectroscopy, performing
super-resolution holographic imaging with synthetic aperture with simultaneous
acquisition, holographic imaging of ultrafast events by encoding different temporal
events into the parallel channels using laser pulses, measuring the Jones matrix and
the birefringence of the sample from a single multiplexed hologram, and measuring
several fluorescent microscopy channels and quantitative phase profiles together,
among others. Each of the multiplexing techniques opens new perspectives for applying
holography to efficiently measure challenging biological and metrological samples.
Furthermore, even if the multiplexing is done digitally, off-axis holographic multiplexing
is useful for rapid processing of the wavefront, for holographic compression,
and for visualization purposes. Although each of these applications typically requires a
different optical system or processing, they all share the same theoretical background.
We therefore review the theory, various optical systems, applications, and perspectives
of the field of off-axis holographic multiplexing, with the goal of stimulating its further
development.
