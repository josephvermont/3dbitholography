# MultiplexingHolography

Off-axis holographic multiplexing involves capturing several complex wavefronts, each encoded into off-axis holograms with different interference fringe orientations, simultaneously, with a single camera acquisition. Thus, the multiplexed off-axis hologram can capture several wavefronts at once, where each one encodes different information from the sample, using the same number of pixels typically required for acquiring a single conventional off-axis hologram encoding only one sample wavefront. This gives rise to many possible applications, with focus on acquisition of dynamic samples, with hundreds of scientific papers already published in the last decade. These include fieldof-view multiplexing, depth-of-field multiplexing, angular perspective multiplexing for tomographic phase microscopy for 3-D refractive index imaging, multiple wavelength multiplexing for multiwavelength phase unwrapping or for spectroscopy, performing super-resolution holographic imaging with synthetic aperture with simultaneous acquisition, holographic imaging of ultrafast events by encoding different temporal events into the parallel channels using laser pulses, measuring the Jones matrix and the birefringence of the sample from a single multiplexed hologram, and measuring several fluorescent microscopy channels and quantitative phase profiles together, among others. Each of the multiplexing techniques opens new perspectives for applying holography to efficiently measure challenging biological and metrological samples. Furthermore, even if the multiplexing is done digitally, off-axis holographic multiplexing is useful for rapid processing of the wavefront, for holographic compression, and for visualization purposes. Although each of these applications typically requires a different optical system or processing, they all share the same theoretical background. We therefore review the theory, various optical systems, applications, and perspectives of the field of off-axis holographic multiplexing, with the goal of stimulating its further development.

# Working Concept

Multiplexing maybe thought of a interferening two or more sample beams (in this case, 2) with the reference wave. In figure (b), the image plane has more
intereference as compared with (a). When the fourier transform is taken we can see that multiplexing uses more of the plane with its cross correlation terms.

Upon taking the optical hologram with a digital camera, we can get the multiplexed hologram that looked like images combined together. When the spacial spectrum is taken,
the cross correlation terms are useful when spatial filtering is done followed by an inverse fourier transform in each of the cross correlation. The reconstruction contains several complex fields (amplitude and phase).

# Experimental Setup
The experiment is composed of invidivual hologram with one light source. Three holographic microscopes are combined in an attempt to demonstrate multiplex

The experiment made use of a laser which has a wavelength of 632nm. It was allowed to pass through a set of polarizers and analyzers and mirrors. Then, a collector lens with a focal length of 75 mm what's used and that the focus is where the aperture was located. After that,  the wave was  allowed to pass through a condenser with the focal length of  750 mm.  so this setup is the microscopic setup and this is also  used as a collimator.  Wendy collimation was done, it was allowed to pass through the sample followed by the objective lens and then you have another set of two lends and then the mirror followed by another lands and then the grating(110lpmm) and then you know have L1 and L2 which both has a focal length of 150mm. Compared to the beam splitter which is used for the traditional holography, we use the grating to separate the beams into two and then combined with the help of the following lens. The beams separated will then be overlapped and the information will be processed to get the phase of the sample.

Rearrangement of the holograms with one path leading to multiple holograms and compare. As a plan, wavelength multiplexing will be done with incoherent and coherent holography. Analyses of the architecture will be done based on the selected hologram. The main advantage of using off-axis holographic multiplexing is to speed
up the acquisition of the complex wavefront data. Being able to perform highly rapid acquisition and processing of complex wavefronts in a quantitative, nondestructive,
and nonintrusive manner is expected to open new horizons for biomedical and metrological applications.
